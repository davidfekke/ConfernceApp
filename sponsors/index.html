<h2>Our Sponsors</h2>
<p>We would like to thank our sponsors, who without their support, the IT Pro Camp would not be a success.</p>

<div class="row">
{% for sponsor in site.data.sponsors %}
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<img src="/images/{{ sponsor.image }}" class="img-responsive" />
	</div>
{% endfor %}
